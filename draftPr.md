Just writing up a draft of what will be used when submitting to [obsidian-releases](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases).

# I am submitting a new Community Plugin

## Repo URL

Link to my plugin: https://github.com/metruzanca/obsidian-publisher

## Release Checklist

<!-- TODO insert the checklist -->

## Notes

I'd like this plugin to be able to publish to any and all platforms, so I think the name "publisher" fits. However, I noticed that such a name, has previously been an issue as as with [SaraVieira](https://github.com/SaraVieira)'s "[Obsidian Notes Publish](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/pull/752)".

> Just reiterating: the conflict between "Obsidian Publish" and "Obsidian Notes Publish" will be very confusing, so I think we need to find another title for this.

I'd like to think that "Publisher" is akin to "Templater", but since thats a very old plugin I can understand that it might have been _grandfathered in_. So if "publisher" is not to your liking, I'm happy to compromise and use an alternative. (_e.g. "Cross-Publisher" or "Blog Publisher"_)
